### My First Semester Project

This project is a culmination of my dedication and passion for science and programming. It's the result of my first-semester project, where I applied my knowledge and skills to create a user-friendly scientific calculator. I designed this to simplify my mathematical journey as a computer science student.

## Unlock the Power of Science with the GUI-based Scientific Calculator!

Welcome to my world of science and calculations. I've built a sleek, user-friendly Scientific Calculator with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using PyQt5, turning complex mathematics into a delightful experience. Starting from basic concepts, we dive deep into advanced functions, providing you with a comprehensive tool for solving complex problems.


### What I've Covered

Throughout the development of this scientific calculator, I've explored a wide range of programming and mathematical concepts, including:

- **Functions:** From simple ones to advanced recursive functions.
- **Data Structures:** Lists, dictionaries, tuples, and list comprehensions.
- **File Handling:** Writing data to files and handling exceptions.
- **Control Structures:** For loops, while loops, and nested structures.
- **Utilization of Libraries:** I've harnessed the power of libraries like Tabulate, Math, and Datetime.
- **User-Defined Functions:** Designed to enhance your mathematical capabilities.

### Embrace the New

In addition to the fundamentals taught in class, I also added new content which I self-learned during the semester, including:

- **PyQt5 Library:** Creating an appealing graphical user interface.
- **Functools Library:** Mastering partial functions.
- **Sys Module:** Enhancing system-level interactions.
- **Graphical User Interface:** Beautifully designed to make calculations enjoyable.
- **Objects and Classes:** I've adopted Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to implement the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, enhancing the calculator's functionality.
- **Date and Time Module:** Ensuring you're never late for an important date.

Furthermore, I've personalized this project by creating a customized icon for the .exe file, adding a unique touch to the user experience.

### The Model-View-Controller (MVC) Method

To ensure a robust and maintainable structure for this scientific calculator, I've employed the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. Here's how it works:

- **Model:** The core logic and data of the calculator are encapsulated in the model. It handles mathematical operations and data storage. This separation ensures a clean and organized core. In the code, you can find the `evaluateExpression` function, which is responsible for evaluating mathematical expressions.

- **View:** The user interface is managed by the view. It displays data to the user and receives input from them. The PyQt5 library enhances the aesthetics and user experience. In the code, the view is defined in the `PyCalcWindow` class.

- **Controller:** The controller acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It processes user input, communicates with the model to perform calculations, and updates the view to display results. In the code, you can see the `pyCalc` class, which connects user input to mathematical calculations and updates the display.

This separation of concerns makes the code modular, maintainable, and scalable, following best practices in software architecture.


### Calculator Versions

- **Version 1:** Basic arithmetic operations.
- **Version 2:** Improved user interface by implementing HTML and added additional functions like square roots, trigonometric operations etc.
- **Version 3:** User-defined mathematical functions like decimal to binary conversion.
- **Version 4:** Data preservation with CSV file support, further HTML and CSS use (different colours for hovering, clicking, default etc.)
